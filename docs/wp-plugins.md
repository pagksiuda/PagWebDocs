WordPress is hosted on Kinsta, and served as a network of sites under a single WP instance. That means there's a master WP admin dashboard, and one for each of the hosted sites.

Plug-ins and themes require regular updates and all that is reflected on the main parent dashboard. That's also where the paid plug-ins are registered. You can network activate a plug-in or theme for the entire network or wait to activate on a site-by-site basis. The heavy-use plug-ins are all network activated.

We have two paid plug-ins and one paid theme:

**BSK PDF Pro**

BSK manages and serves our document library. It's installed only on the sites requiring a document library (PAG, RTA). The plug-in for each site can be managed directly from the BSK entry in the left nav of the site WP admin panel.

**Office 365 Outlook Display**

This serves our calendar. It pulls event entries for designated Outlook 365 calendars. You can see the particular for that process [here](/event-workflow.md). The plug-in for each site can be managed directly from the Microsoft 365 entry in the left nav of the site WP admin panel.

**Generate Press**

This is our theme and provides the front-end template framework for all sites on our network. It has a specific structure provided through the Customize interface where/how things can be managed. Curt manages this portion, and Kristin provides some CSS entries as well.
