-The primary objective of our website is to deliver information, and we should expect a range of users from the casual browser to the focused seeker. 

-The site is built using the Generate Press framework on WordPress. Kristin owns the style (CSS) and Curt owns the CMS, functionality, and code (HTML, including elements/hooks). Several items on PAG are copied from the RTA code library and vice versa. The platform is the same so components are fully interchangeable. 

 -We have two page types: Page and Post. Page is a more rigid structure that contains both content pieces and references/pointers to additional content further down the line. This includes the homepage and inside index pages. Posts are ideally suited for single content pieces such as news, blogs, press releases, etc. They are content endpoints that don't lead elsewhere. Editors can edit all Posts, Curt edits Pages.

-Content is organized and delivered according to a taxonomy, which Curt owns/manages. That taxonomy is represented in the CMS (unique for each site) and delivered to the site as Categories. This forms the structual hierarchy of the site content. The site navigation is a window into the site taxonomy, but itsn't necessarily a direct mirror. Nav can - and should - be more dynamic.

-Posts can also have 'tags' which act as proxy categories, but aren't maintained in a rigid structure. Tags act as an aggregation tool and give us the ability to generate dynamic index pages focusing on relevant topics and themes. 

-We also have to deliver documents. These documents have their own rules for formatting and content. They will delivered using dedicated software components and will have their own micro-taxonomy. Same goes for events.
